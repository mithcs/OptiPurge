## NOTE ⚠️

### History:

I developed 1st edition of this project to make my machine faster(_did I say squeeze every last bit of performance without changing OS_) with as less effort as possible. Then I realized that this problem exists on many machine and can be used on some there too which led to development of 2nd edition which included more features.

### Source Code:

I lost the source code of this project a long time ago. But, I did found some bits that I used as base for this project. You can check them out in [src-bits](https://github.com/mithcs/OptiPurge/tree/master/src-bits) directory. As I use Linux these days, I do not plan to re-write this. So this project is discontinued. However, if someone wants to re-write this project for any reason, they are welcome to do that.

### Binary:

The binary in releases is not optimized binary for release. But it is the only one I have.

### Recommendation:

This software is very useful on every machine whether its some potato or a big guy.

#### Potato Machine:

If you have low-end machine (like really old): consider not using windows. If you still plan on using windows consider using some debloater with this software and strip up as much things as possible.

#### Big Guy:

If you have a nice PC but it feels laggy, OptiPurge might be what you need. And automating junk clearance can be very helpful in saving more time.
